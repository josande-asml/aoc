[2025 Day 1] Part 3 Use the right method!

There is a rapid click-click-click... and then nothing...

You are pretty sure that you have correctly entered the number, so you verify your 
count and enter it again. Click-click-click...

Something is wrong, definitively wrong. You must proceed with method. Method! 
What is this strange method mentioned twice in the instructions? You look again at 
the document and on its back, there is a hand-written note saying "multiply by the
method". Could it be that each instruction, like L50, must be in fact considered as
L(50 * 0x434C49434B), or L14452133930150?

Your heart is pounding in your chest while you carefully count the number of times
any click causes the dial to point at 0, regardless of whether it happens during a
rotation or at the end of one.

What is the password to open the door?
