[2025 day 2] Part 3 One Single Range!

The clerk looks at you in awe.

- I never thought this would be that easy - he said with a clearly reverent tone - 
and I am wondering whether it would be possible to identify all the wrong product IDs
between 1 and 2 ** 32 which is the highest product code possible, in order to prevent
the same mistake in the future.

Using the exact same rules as in part 2, calculate the sum of all the product IDs 
which are invalid, within the range 1 - 4294967296.
