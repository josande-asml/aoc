[2025 Day 3 (Part 3)] Caught in the middle!

The escalator starts moving, at the beginning very slowly but it quickly reaches a
speed that would make it very dangerous to use. You and the Elf discuss about the 
situation and you agree that it is not only dangerous for whoever works here but it
could break the mechanism so you must act quickly.

- May be we should use a jolt that is higher than the minimum but lower than the
maximum, a value that is the closest to the average of these two values.

If we take the first battery bank, 987654321111111, its highest value still is 
987654321111. Its lowest value is 654321111111, so the average is (987654321111 + 
654321111111) / 2 = 820987716111. The nearest jolt you can build is 854321111111.

Using the example,

   987654321111111
   811111111111119
   234234234234278
   818181911112111

what is the sum of the four jolts which are the nearest to the average of each bank.

(Bonus: try running your program using your own input, but no one will be able to 
validate your result...)
