[2025 Day 5 (Part 3)] Super-fresh Ingredients!

The Elves are very happy and insist that you enjoy a hot drink in their warm and 
cosy cafeteria. Of course, you accept their generous offer and you start relaxing. 
You are at the exact moment before falling asleep, when the mind wanders. You see 
escalators filled with rolls of paper, ingredients dancing with an open safe. You
even imagine super-fresh ingredients!

A super-fresh ingredient is an ingredient that appears in two or more ranges.

Consider the example:

3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

The ingredients 12, 13 and 14 appear in the ranges 10-14 and 12-18. The 
ingredients 16, 17, 18 appear in the ranges 16-20 and 12-18. So there are
6 super-fresh ingredients in this example.

How many super-fresh ingredients do you count in your input file?
